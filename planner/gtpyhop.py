"""
GTPyhop is a planner based on Pyhop, that can plan for both tasks and
goals. It requires Python 3. 

This file provides the following classes, functions, and variables. There
are docstrings for each of them. A good place to start might be the
docstrings for find_plan and run_lazy_lookahead.

- classes and their methods: 
    Domain:    copy, display
    Multigoal: copy, display
    State:     copy, display

- functions:
    find_plan              seek_plan                 run_lazy_lookahead
    declare_actions        declare_commands        
    declare_task_methods   declare_unigoal_methods   declare_multigoal_methods
    print_actions          print_commands            print_methods
    get_type               m_split_multigoal

- global variables:
    current_domain         verbose          verify_goals

Accompanying this file are a README.md file that gives an overview of GTPyhop,
and several files that give examples of how to use GTPyhop. To run them, try
importing one or more of the following from the Examples directory:
    simple_goals                simple_tasks
    simple_tasks_with_error     backtracking_tasks
    blocks_tasks                blocks_goals
    blocks_goal_splitting       pyhop_simple_travel_example

    m_split_multigoal is the only multigoal method that GTPyhop provides, and

        - state is the current state
        - multigoal is the multigoal to achieve 

    If multigoal is true in the current state, then m_split_multigoal returns
    []. Otherwise, it returns a goal list [g_1, ..., g_n, multigoal], where
    g_1, ..., g_n are the goals in multigoal that aren't true in the current
    state. This tells the planner to achieve g_1, ..., g_n sequentially, and
    then try again to achieve multigoal. 

    If the planner again uses m_split_multigoal to try to achieve multigoal,
    m_split_multigoal will produce another list like the one above. This will
    keep happening until the planner produces a state in which all of the
    goals in multigoal are simultaneously true.

    The main problem with m_split_multigoal is that it isn't smart about
    choosing the order in which to achieve g_1, ..., g_n. Some orderings may
    work much better than others. Thus it might be desirable to modify
    the method to use a heuristic function to choose a good order.
